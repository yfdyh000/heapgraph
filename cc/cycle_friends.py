# Find the objects that are rooting a particular object (or objects of
# a certain class) in the cycle collector graph
#
# This works by reversing the graph, then flooding to find roots.
#
# There are various options to alter what is treated as a root, but
# these are mostly experimental, so they may not produce particularly
# useful results.
#
# --node-name-as-root nsRange (for example) will treat all objects
# with the node name nsRange as roots.  This is useful if a previous
# analysis has determined that a leak always involves an object being
# held onto by a certain class, and you want to continue with manual
# analysis starting at that object.
