# CCC: Cycle collector checker.
#
# Implementation of the cycle collector algorithm in Python, along
# comparison of those results to those reported by Fx.  There are also
# a few basic well-formedness checks that are done.
#
# Same basic idea as Bacon-Rajan 01, but implemented slightly
# differently, as we examine the entire CC heap:
#
#   - Compute the number of edges in the graph pointing to each node
#     (the 'internal counts').
#
#   - Compute the set of ref-counted roots, which are ref-counted
#     objects where the ref count is greater than the internal count.
#
#   - Compute live set of objects reachable from marked GC objects or
#     ref-counted roots.
#
#   - Convert output to the same format as the FX CC.  Any objects in
#     the set of live objects are garbage.


# Arguments: one or more cycle collector edge files, which will be checked in sequence.
